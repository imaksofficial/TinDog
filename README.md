# 🐶 Dog Tinder – A Dating Website for Dogs

Yes, you read that right. Why should humans have all the fun?  
**Dog Tinder** is a mock dating site designed for dogs — because love has no species limit! 🐾

Built with **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**, this project mimics a swipe-based dating interface (similar to Tinder) to display adorable doggo profiles and allow playful interaction. It’s fun, responsive, and entirely creative.
